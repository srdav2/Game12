# ⚠️ Unmapped Exercise Handling Feature

## Overview

The Hevy to Garmin FIT Merger now includes **intelligent unmapped exercise detection** with an interactive mapping dialog. When the application encounters Hevy exercises that don't have predefined Garmin mappings, it will automatically pause the process and ask the user to manually select appropriate Garmin exercises.

## 🚨 **How It Works**

### 1. **Automatic Detection**
- Application scans all Hevy exercises during processing
- Compares against the 200+ exercise database
- Identifies any exercises without Garmin mappings

### 2. **Warning Dialog**
When unmapped exercises are found:
- ⚠️ **Modal warning dialog** appears
- Lists all unmapped exercises from your Hevy data
- Provides dropdown selection for each unmapped exercise
- Shows **suggested mappings** based on keyword matching

### 3. **Smart Suggestions**
The system automatically suggests the best Garmin exercise match:
- **Keyword matching**: Finds exercises with common words
- **Category awareness**: Suggests exercises from the same category
- **Fallback options**: Generic categories if no specific match found

### 4. **User Selection**
- **Dropdown menu** with all available Garmin exercises
- **Organized options**: Generic categories + alphabetical exercise list
- **Real-time preview**: See exactly what will be mapped

### 5. **Persistent Mapping**
- User selections are **remembered** for the current session
- Mappings applied to all sets of the same exercise
- **Future-ready**: Framework for saving mappings permanently

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### Workflow Integration
```
Select Files → Process → ⚠️ UNMAPPED EXERCISES FOUND → Map Exercises → Continue → Preview → Export
```

### Dialog Interface
```
⚠️ Unmapped Exercises Found

Found 2 exercise(s) that don't have Garmin mappings.
Please select the closest Garmin exercise for each one below:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Hevy Exercise: Unknown Super Exercise                   │
│ Map to Garmin Exercise: [Dropdown with suggestions]    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Hevy Exercise: Another Unmapped Exercise               │
│ Map to Garmin Exercise: [Dropdown with suggestions]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Select the closest Garmin exercise for each unmapped Hevy exercise.
The application will remember these mappings for future use.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Detection Logic
```python
def find_unmapped_exercises(self, parsed_hevy_data):
    """Find exercises that don't have Garmin mappings"""
    exercise_mappings = self.config.get("exercise_mappings", {})
    unmapped_exercises = set()
    
    for set_data in parsed_hevy_data:
        exercise_name = set_data['exercise_name']
        if exercise_name not in exercise_mappings:
            unmapped_exercises.add(exercise_name)
    
    return list(unmapped_exercises)
```

### Smart Suggestions
```python
def find_suggested_mapping(self, unmapped_exercise):
    """Find the best suggested mapping for an unmapped exercise"""
    # Keyword matching algorithm
    # Finds exercises with most common words
    # Returns best match or generic fallback
```

### Workflow Integration
- **Background Thread**: File processing continues in background
- **Main Thread**: Dialog shown on main UI thread
- **Modal Dialog**: Prevents other interactions until resolved
- **Error Handling**: Graceful cancellation and error recovery

## 📊 **Testing Results**
